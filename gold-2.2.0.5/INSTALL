                        GOLD INSTALLATION NOTES

Introduction:
=============

Gold uses the standard configure, make and make install steps for installation. However, there are a number of preparation, prerequisite, post-install configuration, and post-startup customization steps that need to be performed.
This document provides general installation guidance and provides a number of sample steps referenced to a particular installation on a Linux platform using the bash shell. These steps indicate the userid in brackets performing the step. The exact commands to be performed and the user that issues them will vary based on the platform, shell, installation preferences etc. 
  
Install Prerequisites:
======================

  You will first need to build, test and install the following prerequisites:

  o Perl 5.8 or higher (with suidperl) [REQUIRED]:
    ----------------------------------------

    The gold server and clients are written in Perl. Perl 5.8 or higher is
    required. The perl installation must include suidperl for proper client
    authentication.  Use 'perl -v' to see what level of Perl is installed and
    'suidperl -v' to see if suidperl is installed.
    Perl is available at: <http://www.perl.com/>

    For RedHat-based systems:

    [root]  yum install perl perl-suidperl

    For Debian-based systems:

    [root]  apt-get install perl perl-suid

  o PostgreSQL database 7.2 or higher [OPTIONAL]:
    ------------------------------------

    Gold makes use of a database for transactions and data persistence.
    Three databases have been tested for use with Gold thus far: PostgreSQL,
    MySQL and SQLite. Use of other SQL databases have been used and should be
    possible. PostgreSQL and mySQL are external databases that must be
    separately installed, configured and started, while SQLite is an embedded
    database bundled with the Gold source code. The only thing needed for
    SQLite is the sqlite3 client for bootstrapping.
    PostgreSQL is available at: <http://www.postgresql.org/>
    
    For PostgreSQL on RedHat-based systems:

    [root]  yum install postgresql postgresql-libs postgresql-server postgresql-devel

    For PostgreSQL on Debian-based systems:

    [root]  apt-get install postgresql postgresql-common postgresql-client postgresql-server-dev-8.4

    For MySQL on RedHat-based systems:

    [root]  yum install mysql mysql-server

    For MySQL on Debian-based systems:

    [root]  apt-get install mysql-common mysql-server libmysqlclient-dev

    For SQLite on RedHat-based systems:

    [root]  yum install sqlite

    For SQLite on Debian-based systems:

    [root]  apt-get install sqlite3

 o libxml2 2.4.25 or higher [REQUIRED]:
    -------------------

    LibXML2 is needed by the XML::LibXML perl module to communicate via
    the SSSRMAP message format. The libxml2 development package is needed
    for the XML::LibXML perl module to install properly.
    LibXML2 is available at: <http://www.xmlsoft.org/>

    For RedHat-based systems:

    [root]  yum install libxml2 libxml2-devel

    For Debian-based systems:

    [root]  apt-get install libxml2 libxml2-dev

 o gnu readline 2.0 or higher [OPTIONAL]:
    -------------------

    The interactive control program (goldsh) can support command-line-editing
    capabilities if readline support is enabled. Most recent linux
    distributions come with the appropriate readline support.

    For Debian-based systems:

    [root]  apt-get install ncurses-dev libreadline-dev
    [root]  cpan Term::ReadLine::Gnu

  o Apache Httpd Server 2.0 or higher [OPTIONAL]:
    -----------------------------------------------

    Gold provides a web-based gui so that managers, users and administrators
    can interact with the accounting and allocation system. The web interface
    utilizes Perl CGI and SSL and needs an httpd server (preferably apache).
    Apache httpd is available at: <http://httpd.apache.org/>
    
    For RedHat-based systems:

    [root]  yum install httpd

    For Debian-based systems:

    [root]  apt-get install apache2

  o OpenSSL 0.9.5a or higher [OPTIONAL]:
    -----------------------------------------------

    If you are installing the gui you will need SSL (preferably OpenSSL).
    OpenSSL is a command line toolkit for using secure socket layer encryption
    on a server. 
    OpenSSL is available at: <http://www.openssl.org/>
    
    For RedHat-based systems:
    
    [root]  yum install openssl
    
    For Debian-based systems:

    [root]  apt-get install openssl

  o mod_ssl 2.0 or higher [OPTIONAL]:
    -----------------------------------------------

    If you are installing the gui you will need an apache interface to OpenSSL
    (preferably mod_ssl). There are other alternatives to mod_ssl (one of which
    is apache-ssl from which the mod_ssl code was forked), however mod_ssl has
    become the defacto standard and is the most widely adopted. mod_ssl is
    often bundled as part of the httpd server (such as in Ubuntu).
    mod_ssl is available at: <http://www.modssl.org/>
    
    For RedHat-based systems:

    [root]  yum install mod_ssl

    For Debian-based systems:

    [root]  a2enmod ssl

Preparation:
============

To build and install Gold, you need to unpack the archive and
change directory into the top directory of the distribution.
For maximum security, it is recommended that you install and run Gold
under its own non-root userid.

  [root]  useradd -m gold
  [root]  passwd gold

  [gold]  mkdir ~/src
  [gold]  cd ~/src
  [gold]  gzip -cd gold-2.2.0.5.tar.gz | tar xvf -
  [gold]  cd gold-2.2.0.5

Configuration:
==============

To configure Gold, run the "configure" script provided with the
distribution.  

To see the list of options:

  -h, --help              display the list of options

Use prefix to tell it where Gold should be installed (defaults to /opt/gold):

  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX [/opt/gold]

Use with-db to specify the database you intend to use with Gold. Currently only PostgreSQL (Pg), MySQL (mysql) and SQLite (SQLite) have been tested for use with Gold. Postgres and mySQL are external databases which run in a distinct (possibly remote) process and communicate over sockets while SQLite is an embedded database bundled with Gold with SQL queries being performed within the goldd process itself through library calls. Initial testing has shown SQLite to be at least as fast as PostgreSQL and MySQL for small installations. The default is to use PostgreSQL.

  --with-db=DATABASE        database to be used { Pg, mysql, SQLite } [Pg]

Use with-user to specify the userid that gold will run under (defaults to the
user running the configure command).

  --with-user=USER        user id under which the gold server will run

Use with-perl-libs to indicate whether you want to install the required perl modules in a local gold directory (PREFIX/lib) or in the default system site-perl directory (triggered by running make deps).

  --with-perl-libs=local|site       install policy for prerequisite perl libs [local]

Use with-gold-libs to indicate whether you want to install the Gold modules in a local gold directory (PREFIX/lib) or in the default system site-perl directory (defaults to local).

  --with-gold-libs=local|site  install policy for Gold perl libs [local]

Use with-cgi-bin to specify the directory you want the cgi-bin files to be installed to for the web gui (defaults to /var/www/cgi-bin/gold).

  --with-cgi-bin=DIR      directory to install cgi-bin files if using web gui [/var/www/cgi-bin/gold]

The PERL environment variable helps the install process find the desired (5.6) perl interpreter if it is not in your path or not found first in a path search.

  PERL        full pathname of the Perl interpreter

To assume the defaults, just run configure.

  [gold]  cd gold-2.2.0.5
  [gold]  ./configure

Compilation:
============

To compile the program, type make.

  [gold]  make

If you would like to install the web gui, type make gui.

  [gold]  make gui

Perl Module Dependencies:
=========================

Gold requires the use of a number of Perl modules. These modules are included
in tarball form in the Gold distribution and they can be installed by typing
'make deps'.

  [root]  make deps

This will install the following Perl modules as necessary. By default, these will be installed under gold's lib/perl5 directory. To install these in the system site-perl directory, use the configure parameter with-perl-libs as described in the configuration section.

    CGI.pm
    CGI::Session
    Compress::Zlib
    Crypt::CBC
    Crypt::DES
    Crypt::DES_EDE3
    Data::Properties
    Date::Manip
    DBI
    DBD::Pg, DBD::mysql or DBD::SQLite
    Digest
    Digest::HMAC
    Digest::MD5
    Digest::SHA1
    Error
    Log::Dispatch
    Log::Dispatch::FileRotate
    Log::Log4perl
    MIME::Base64
    Module::Build
    Params::Validate
    SOAP
    Term::ReadLine::Gnu
    Time::HiRes
    XML::SAX
    XML::LibXML::Common
    XML::LibXML
    XML::NamespaceSupport

If you would prefer to do so, you could install these modules via other sources, such as from rpm, or from CPAN using 'cpan'.

Installation:
=============

Use `make install' to install Gold. You may need to do this as root if any of the installation or log directories do not already have write permission as the gold admin user.

  [root]  make install

If you would like to try out the web-gui, type make install-gui.

  [root]  make install-gui
 
You will also need to generate a secret key which enables secure communication 
between clients and server. This key is a pass-phrase consisting of up to 80
characters and can include spaces and the regular visible ASCII characters.
Note that if you are using Gold with the Moab or Maui Scheduler, they will need
both need to use a shared secret key.

  [root]  make auth_key
Enter your secret key (up to 80 characters and can include spaces): mysecret

To delete the files created by the Gold installation, you can use
'make uninstall'.

General Setup:
==============

Edit the Gold configuration files as necessary.

  [gold]  vi /opt/gold/etc/goldd.conf
  [gold]  vi /opt/gold/etc/gold.conf

Configure your environment to set the following environment variables:

  PATH          [RECOMMENDED] should contain PREFIX/bin and PREFIX/sbin.
  GOLD_HOME     [OPTIONAL] set to the installation root (PREFIX).

  [gold]  echo export PATH=$PATH:$GOLD_HOME/bin:$GOLD_HOME/sbin >> $HOME/.bash_profile
  [gold]  echo export GOLD_HOME=/opt/gold >> $HOME/.bash_profile
  [gold]  . $HOME/.bash_profile

Database Setup:
===============

If you are using the PostgreSQL database you will need to configure the
database to allow trusted internet connections from the Gold server host.

  # Add the IP ADDRESS of the host where the Gold server will run 
  # ( even if it is the same host as the database server )
  [postgres]  vi /etc/postgresql/8.4/main/pg_hba.conf
host    all         all         192.168.1.99/16       trust

  # Configure postgres to accept connections from your host
  [postgres] vi /etc/postgresql/8.4/main/postgresql.conf
listen_addresses = 'mygoldserver,localhost' # what IP address(es) to listen on;

If you are using the MySQL database you will need to configure the server to
support transactions (MySQL 5.5.5 and later supports transactions by default).

  [root] vi /etc/mysql/my.cnf
default-storage-engine = INNODB   # Place under the [mysqld] section

Add the "gold" user as a database administrator

  For PostgreSQL database:

  [postgres]  createuser gold  
  Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) y

  For MySQL database:

  [mysql]  mysql
  create user gold;
  grant all on *.* to 'gold'@'localhost';

Create the gold database (as the gold user)

  For PostgreSQL database:

  [gold]  createdb gold

  For MySQL database:

  [gold]  mysql
  create database gold;

Web Server Setup:
=================

If you want to use the Gold web GUI, you will need to configure your Httpd
server to use SSL. For RedHat Linux systems, a good guide on this is
"Buiding a Secure RedHat Apache Server HOWTO" at
<http://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-HOWTO/SSL-RedHat-HOWTO.html>.

The following shows an example configuration that involves making some
modifications to the httpd configuration to support the use of cgi-bin
and SSL connections as well as the creation of a private key and a
self-signed certificate.

Edit the httpd configuration file:

  [root]  cd /etc/apache2
  [root]  vi sites-enabled/000-default

# Add a virtual host definition and edit as appropriate for your environment:
<VirtualHost *:443>
  DocumentRoot /var/www/cgi-bin
  ServerName mygoldserver.mysite.org
  ServerAdmin My.Email@mysite.org
  ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/gold-error_log
  TransferLog /var/log/apache2/gold-access_log
  SSLEngine on
  SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl.crt/gold-server.crt
  SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl.key/gold-server.key
  SetEnvIf User-Agent ".*MSIE.*" nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown
  
  # Configure your cgi-bin directory
  <Directory "/var/www/cgi-bin">
    Options ExecCGI
    AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl
  </Directory>
 
  # Create an Alias for /cgi-bin pointing to your cgi-bin directory
  # You may also have to comment out any comparable ScriptAlias definition
  #ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/lib/cgi-bin/
  Alias /cgi-bin/ /var/www/cgi-bin/

  # Add index.cgi to the DirectoryIndex so you can use the shorter dir name
  DirectoryIndex index.cgi
</VirtualHost>

Create a Private Key for Gold

  [root]  openssl genrsa -out ssl.key/gold-server.key 1024

Create a Self-Signed Certificate

  [root]  openssl req -new -key ssl.key/gold-server.key -x509 -out ssl.crt/gold-server.crt

Start or restart httpd

  [root]  service apache2 restart

Bootstrap:
==========

You will need to populate the gold database with an sql dump that defines the
objects, actions and attributes necessary to function as an Accounting and
Allocation Manager.

If you are using Postgres:

  [gold]  psql gold < bank.sql

If you are using Mysql:

  [gold]  mysql gold < bank.sql

If you are using SQLite:

  [gold]  sqlite3 /opt/gold/data/gold.db < bank.sql

Startup:
========

Start the gold server daemon. It is located in the PREFIX/sbin directory.

  [gold]  goldd

Alternatively, if you are on a linux system that supports init.d scripts, you can create a system startup service for gold. Sample scripts are provided in contrib/init.d/ that can be edited for your distribution and installed into /etc/init.d. After adding execute permissions, Gold can then be started by issuing:

  [root]  service gold start
  
Initialization:
===============

You are now ready to define acounts, make deposits, etc. as
necessary for your site. Refer to the Gold User's Guide (doc/userguide.pdf)
for this phase of the Gold setup. The Getting Started chapter should provide
a useful primer.

Customization:
==============

Creating and modifying objects and attributes can be accomplished through the
goldsh client as described in the Gold User's Guide but documentation for this
is limited. You may contact Adaptive Computing Enterprises, Inc. for 
consultation or support by sending email to <gold-support(at)adaptivecomputing.com>.

Accessing the GUI:
==================

To access the web gui, open a browser with url: https://mygoldserver/gold

  [user]  mozilla https://gold-server/gold

Note: In order to use the web gui, users will have to generate passwords for
      themselves using the gchpasswd client command. Gold may have to be
      restarted in order for role privileges to be reflected in the GUI.

  [user]  gchpasswd
