Revision history for Perl extension Log::Dispatch::FileRotate.

0.01  Tue Oct  1 01:12:30 2002
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.20 with options
		-AX -n Log::Dispatch::FileRotate

1.01 Tue Oct  1 01:21:54 EST 2002
	- Real code copied over h2xs stuff.

1.03 Mon Nov 18 17:19:06 EST 2002
	- added multiple writer stuff. Use flock() to handle locks

1.04 Wed Nov 20 13:43:04 EST 2002
	- added Time based constraints.

1.05 Thu Nov 21 09:28:42 EST 2002
	- fixed typos in hash key

1.06 Tue Apr 29 16:08:37 EST 2003
	- moved inode tests around a bit to fix a warning message

1.07 Sun May  4 23:42:03 EST 2003
	- fixed up locking in a forked environment
	- speed up in time mode. Cache recurrences. Much quicker now :-)

1.08 Thu Jun  5 11:27:49 EST 2003
	- now build log.conf at 'make test' time as we keep having people
	  fail due to bad TZ settings
	- Also added some more testing on the recurrances

1.09 Thu Jun  5 17:57:46 EST 2003
	- Even better testing of TZ issues. Try to see if we can work around
	  them by ignoring and then testing results.

1.10 Mon Jun 23 09:40:34 EST 2003
	- Seems defaulting to size in Megs happened between 1.05 and 1.06
	  which is not what people want. So back to bytes now.

1.11 Thu Sep 25 11:18:04 EST 2003
	- Forgot to update the Doco from 1.10. 
	- Added some missing log4j recurrence patterns and made them
	  case insensitive

1.12 Mon Feb 28 23:20:03 EST 2005
	- Added code to handle short running proggies like CGIs that want to
	  use the DatePattern stuff. Now check mtime of log file to see if we
	  need to rotate (at start up only).
	- Got rid of epochs as they conflict with Date::Manip's UnixDate()
	  function on MacOSX. This slows us down quite a bit so I am using
	  cmp instead of Date_Cmp() to get some speed back.
	- Fixed up some typos and removed some email addresses as requested.
	- Not released

1.13 Tue Mar  1 12:04:13 EST 2005
	- Went back to epoch times for comparisions. My comments above
	  regarding Date::Manip and MacOSX are silly.
	- Added better lockfile name picking thanks to Stephen Gordon
	- Removed the $$ from the lockfile name as it makes it too uniq

1.14 Mon Apr 24 13:35:06 EST 2006
	- create copyright notice

1.15 Wed Apr 26 08:09:20 EST 2006
	- Added GPL copyright notice to fit with Perl 5
