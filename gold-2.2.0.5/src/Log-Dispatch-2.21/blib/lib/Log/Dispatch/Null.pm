=head1 NAME

Log::Dispatch::File - Object that accepts messages and does nothing

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Log::Dispatch::Null;

  my $null = Log::Dispatch::Null->new( name      => 'null',
                                       min_level => 'info' );

  $null->log( level => 'emerg', message => "I've fallen and I can't get up\n" );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides a null logging object. Messages can be sent to the
object but it does nothing with them.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item * new(%p)

This method takes a hash of parameters.  The following options are
valid:

=over 8

=item * name ($)

The name of the object (not the filename!).  Required.

=item * min_level ($)

The minimum logging level this object will accept.  See the
Log::Dispatch documentation on L<Log Levels|Log::Dispatch/"Log Levels"> for more information.  Required.

=item * max_level ($)

The maximum logging level this obejct will accept.  See the
Log::Dispatch documentation on L<Log Levels|Log::Dispatch/"Log Levels"> for more information.  This is not
required.  By default the maximum is the highest possible level (which
means functionally that the object has no maximum).

=item * callbacks( \& or [ \&, \&, ... ] )

This parameter may be a single subroutine reference or an array
reference of subroutine references.  These callbacks will be called in
the order they are given and passed a hash containing the following keys:

 ( message => $log_message, level => $log_level )

The callbacks are expected to modify the message and then return a
single scalar containing that modified message.  These callbacks will
be called when either the C<log> or C<log_to> methods are called and
will only be applied to a given message once.

=back

=item * log_message( message => $ )

Sends a message to the appropriate output.  Generally this shouldn't
be called directly but should be called through the C<log()> method
(in Log::Dispatch::Output).
